# DU-4TankFuelScreen

Things to note about this script  
 -  I designed this script specifically for ships with 2 space tanks, and 2 atmo tanks.  
 -  If you require a different setup and are unsure of how to do that, message me on discord Rost#6764, and I'll modify it when I have the chance.
 -  All Colors and Text can be customized down below in Script Configuration, you can either use Hex Codes, or the names of colors  

How to Install this Script  
   -  This install assumes all you have done is placed down an unconfigured programming board, and copied the provided script into it  
   -  Link the following items to the board in this order: Screen, Space Tank, Space Tank, Atmo Tank, Atmo Tank  
   -  Once you have linked the items, check the configuration down below, and edit the names and colors accordingly  
   -  Note: Space Tank 1 is the first you linked, Atmo Tank 1 is the first you linked  
   -  Once everything has been linked and configured, get into the pilots seat, and wait for the fuel bars on the bottom right to load, then exit  
   -  You can now activate the programming board, and the ship should work as intended
